# FileChecker

With FileChecker, you can quickly check if a file exists - even if there are many, e.g. by preparing data for importing products into WooCommerce.
 
Before running the script, define the `$files_list` variable.

**Sample data entry key:**
```
string 'http://domain.com/image.jpg;http://domain.com/image2.jpg'
```
